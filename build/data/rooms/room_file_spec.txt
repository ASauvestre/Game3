            "texture" : sets the texture of the tile. (opt)

    "end_tile"   : to end the tile block.

Collision blocks:
    "begin_collision" : followed by (one x/x_range and y/y_range)

                    "x_range" : two float corresponding to the range of x coordinates
                                between the left ad right of the block.
                    "y"       : single float for the y coordinate.
                    "y_range" : two float corresponding to the range of y coordinates
                                between the top and bottom of the block.

            "restriction" :  who can collide against this ? {player_only}. (opt)
